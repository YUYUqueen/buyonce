# BuyOnce Cold Start Drafts

**Title:**
Show HN: BuyOnce – A curated directory of 39 buy-once, no-subscription software tools

**Body:**

I got tired of every tool I use becoming a subscription. So I built BuyOnce — a simple directory of software you pay for once and own forever.

It currently lists 39 tools across 8 categories: developer tools, design, productivity, notes & writing, security & privacy, system utilities, photo & video, and finance.

The criteria are straightforward: one-time purchase, no recurring fees, actively maintained. I excluded anything that gates core features behind a subscription or has gone unmaintained.

I built this mostly for myself — I was spending too much time searching for alternatives every time a tool I liked switched to subscriptions. Figured others might find it useful too.

Happy to hear suggestions for tools I missed or categories worth adding.

I made a directory of 39 software tools you can buy once — no subscriptions, no recurring fees

**Body:**

Hey r/software,

I've been building a curated list of buy-once software as a side project: [https://buyonce.yuyuqueen.com](https://buyonce.yuyuqueen.com)

The idea is simple — every entry is a tool where you pay once and you're done. No subscriptions, no annual renewals, no "free tier that nags you to upgrade monthly."

Right now it covers 39 tools across 8 categories:

- Developer Tools
- Design
- Productivity
- Notes & Writing
- Security & Privacy
- System Utilities
- Photo & Video
- Finance

I tried to only include stuff that's actively maintained and genuinely useful — not abandonware that happens to be a one-time purchase.

If you know of tools that should be on the list, drop them in the comments. I want to keep expanding it based on what people actually use and recommend.

Built a curated directory of buy-once Mac software — 39 tools, no subscriptions

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

Like a lot of you here, I prefer paying once for my software. The problem is finding which apps still offer that option — it feels like every month another tool I rely on switches to a subscription model.

So I put together BuyOnce: [https://buyonce.yuyuqueen.com](https://buyonce.yuyuqueen.com)

It's a curated directory of 39 one-time-purchase tools across categories like developer tools, design, productivity, notes & writing, system utilities, photo & video, and more. Most of them are Mac-native or Mac-first apps.

Each listing is something I've either used personally or vetted to make sure it's actively maintained and the one-time purchase actually gives you the full product — not a crippled version pushing you toward a subscription.

I'd love to hear what buy-once Mac apps you swear by that I might have missed. The goal is to make this a genuinely useful resource for this community.

## 4. Reddit r/SaaS

**Title:**
The counter-trend: I cataloged 39 software tools that still let you pay once and own them

**Body:**

There's a lot of discussion here about SaaS pricing, MRR, and subscription models — and for good reason, recurring revenue is the business model everyone wants.

But from the buyer's side, subscription fatigue is real. I tallied up my software subscriptions last month and the number was honestly uncomfortable. Many of them are tools I use maybe a few times a week.

So I built BuyOnce ([https://buyonce.yuyuqueen.com](https://buyonce.yuyuqueen.com)) — a curated directory of 39 software tools across 8 categories that still offer one-time purchases. Developer tools, design, productivity, notes, security, utilities, photo/video, finance.

What's interesting from a business perspective: many of these companies are doing well. Turns out "pay once, get free updates for this major version" is a model that still works — it just doesn't get the VC hype.

A few observations from putting this together:

- Solo developers and small teams dominate this space
- Many use a "paid major upgrades" model (buy v3, pay again for v4) which still generates recurring-ish revenue without locking users in
- Customer loyalty tends to be extremely high — people evangelize tools they feel they actually own

Curious what this community thinks. Is buy-once making a quiet comeback, or am I just in a bubble?

## 5. Twitter/X Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**

I added up my software subscriptions last month.

$847/year. For tools I don't even use daily.

So I went looking for alternatives you pay for once. Found 39 of them. Built a directory.

**Tweet 2 (What it is):**

It's called BuyOnce — a curated directory of software with no subscriptions.

39 tools across 8 categories:
→ Developer tools
→ Design
→ Productivity
→ Notes & Writing
→ Security & Privacy
→ System Utilities
→ Photo & Video
→ Finance

https://buyonce.yuyuqueen.com

**Tweet 3 (Examples/Insight):**

What surprised me: most of the best buy-once tools are built by solo devs or small teams.

No VC pressure to switch to subscriptions.
No growth-at-all-costs pricing experiments.

Just good software at a fair price. You pay, you own it.

**Tweet 4 (CTA):**

The directory is open and I'm actively adding to it.

If you know a buy-once tool that deserves to be listed, reply or DM me.

Goal: make this the go-to resource for people who are done renting their software.
